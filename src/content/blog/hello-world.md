Hey! I'm Quique, a Senior Software Engineer working at commercetools in Valencia, Spain.

I've been meaning to start a blog for a while now. I spend most of my days working with TypeScript, Node.js, and cloud infrastructure — and I've learned a lot of things the hard way that I wish someone had written down.

## What to expect

I plan to write about:

- **Backend engineering** — patterns, pitfalls, and practical advice for building services
- **Cloud infrastructure** — GCP, AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, and the lessons learned from running things in production
- **Developer tooling** — things that make the day-to-day better

Nothing fancy, just things I find useful and hope others will too.

Stay tuned.
